# `rs_dfu`

A high-performance DFU (Device Firmware Update) implementation for flashing
STM32 devices in DFU mode. Built in Rust with C++ interoperability, rs_dfu is
specifically designed for flashing EdgeTX radios and supports both traditional
raw binaries and modern UF2 firmware files.

## Features

- **Multiple Firmware Formats**: 
  - Raw binary files
  - UF2 (USB Flashing Format) firmware files
- **EdgeTX Radio Support**: Optimized for EdgeTX radio hardware, including new platforms with external FLASH
- **Dual Interface**: 
  - Command-line tool (`rdfu`) for direct device flashing
  - C++ library for embedding in custom applications
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Installation

### Pre-built Releases

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/EdgeTX/rs-dfu/releases):

- **Command-line tool**: `rdfu-{os-arch}`
- **C++ library**: `rs_dfu-{target-triple}.tar.gz` containing static library and header

**Please note:**

On macOS, you will probably need to "unflag" the binary before use:
```shell
xattr -c rdfu-macos-arm64
```

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EdgeTX/rs-dfu.git
cd rs-dfu
cargo build --all --release
```

## Command Line Usage

### Basic Operations

List all DFU devices:
```bash
rdfu list
```

Write firmware to device (auto-detects UF2 vs raw binary):
```bash
rdfu write firmware.uf2
rdfu write firmware.bin
```

Read firmware from device:
```bash
rdfu read firmware.bin
```

### Device Selection

Filter devices by vendor/product ID:
```bash
# List only STM32 DFU devices
rdfu list --vendor 0483 --product df11

# Write to specific device
rdfu write --vendor 0483 --product df11 firmware.bin
```

### Advanced Options

Write raw binary to custom address:
```bash
rdfu write --start-address 0x08000000 firmware.bin
```

Read raw binary from custom address with custom length:
```bash
rdfu read --start-address 0x08001000 --length 51640 firmware.bin
```

Reboot EdgeTX radio into DFU bootloader:
```bash
# Reboot with tag address
rdfu reboot 0x08000000

# Reboot specific device 
rdfu reboot --vendor 0483 --product df11 0x08000000
```

Inspect UF2 file contents:
```bash
rdfu uf2 firmware.uf2
```

## C++ Library Usage

### CMake Integration

Extract the library archive and use CMake's `find_package`:

```cmake
# Extract rs_dfu-{target}.tar.gz to your project
find_package(rs_dfu REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(your_app rs_dfu::rs_dfu)
```

### Code Example

```cpp
#include "rs_dfu.h"
#include <stdio.h>

using ::rust::Vec;

void print_devices(const Vec<DfuDevice> &devices)
{
    for (const auto &device : devices) {
        auto dev_info = device.device_info();
        printf("%04x:%04x: %s (0x%08x)\n",
               dev_info.vendor_id,
               dev_info.product_id,
               dev_info.product_string.c_str(),
               device.default_start_address());
    }
}

int main() {
    try {
        // Find DFU devices
        auto device_filter = DfuDeviceFilter::empty_filter();
        auto devices = device_filter->find_devices();
        
        if (devices.empty()) {
            printf("No DFU devices found\n");
            return 1;
        }

        print_devices(devices);
        
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        printf("Error: %s\n", e.what());
        return 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

reporting, see [`examples/cpp/main.cpp`](examples/cpp/main.cpp).

## Development

### Building the Library

The project uses `cxx` for C++ interoperability:

```bash
# Build Rust library
cargo build --all --release

# Generate distribution package
./package.sh
```

This creates a distribution archive containing:
- Static and dynamic libraries
- C++ header files
- CMake configuration files

On Windows, if a debug build is necessary, the library can be built with:
```bash
# Build Rust library
cargo build --all

# Generate distribution package
./package.sh
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Device is not listed or does not reconnect

**On Windows**, if your DFU device is not listed or cannot be connected, it is most
certainly because DFU devices on Windows always need a driver.

You can either:
- use the vendor's driver (if existing),
- use the generic WinUSB driver (see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/winusb-installation#installing-winusb-by-specifying-the-system-provided-device-class))
- or use [Zadig](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/releases)

**On macOS**, you might experience the annoying user confirmation dialog when connecting
a device the first, or maybe even every time. This behaviour can be configured in *System Settings*
(see [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102282)).
